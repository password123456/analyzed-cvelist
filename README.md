# The goal of this..
This repository analyzes and identifies significant CVE vulnerabilities that should be investigated from a list of CVE vulnerabilities collected in real-time and posts them.

The posting is done on a D-1 basis. (UTC/GMT +9) <br>
CVE vulnerabilities collected yesterday are analyzed and posted the next day.

The posted CVE list aims to address security vulnerabilities in IT information and communication services such as IT platforms, commerce, gaming, and e-commerce.

Depending on the Analysis, the number of CVE listings may vary, and custom CVE vulnerabilities that are relevant to me may not be included.

To discover high-quality CVEs based on comprehensive and general criteria, the analysis criteria are periodically adjusted.

At the time of collecting CVEs, some may not have a CVSS Score evaluated.
Those labeled as 'Not Rated' fall into this category.

The 'Summary' column is a classification criterion that allows you to understand the approximate content of the vulnerabilities based on CVE IDs without checking the details of CVEs.
